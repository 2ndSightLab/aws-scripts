# Script Context

* Always follow these instructions when creating new scripts.
* Never change this README.md file. 
* To create a new AWS script, create a new folder with the script name.
* Script folders are all lowercase with a - between each word.
* Within each scipt folder create a bash file named run.sh.
* Within each run.sh file include a shebang with -e.
* Create a file in the scripts directory named README.md and add the name of the script to the top of the readme.
* Add instructions in the script README.md file to always follow all instructions in the global ../README.md and if there is a conflict override with what is in the global README.md file.
