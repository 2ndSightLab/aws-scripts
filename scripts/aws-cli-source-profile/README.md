# AWS CLI Source Profile Script

__Summary__

Create a profile configured with AWS developer credentials. Best practice is to ONLY give those
credentials permission to assume a role with MFA and preferrably also restricted to specific IP
address(es). Then create a separate AWS CLI profile to assume a role with MFA using this script:

## Implementation

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS access key ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS secret access key
- REGION - AWS region (e.g. us-east-1)

## Error Handling
- Check if source profile exists and is valid
- Verify AWS CLI is installed
