# 2SL-3000-Lab-Registration

THiS IS NOT GOOD. 

I never had time to make this very good but this is where students registered for classes to get access to class labs.
The only thing it did was log everything they entered to CloudWatch.
This also allowed me to see all the attacks the students of one class spewed at the registration form. Thanks guys. Really.
Initially the auth tokens weren't even really validated. Not sure it's all right I never actually pentested it because my classes were small and usually at a single company, which in theory shouldn't want to hack it's own class. In theory.

ONE OF THE REASONS I ONLY DO PENTESTING NOW...is because I never had enough time to do *EVERYTHING* well. Now I can focus on doing one thing well - pentesting. I never even had time to really pentest my own class infratructure which is ridiculous. The moral of the story is don't try to do everything. Focus will help you do one thing really well isntead of doing a bunch of things so-so.

Run this command:

./gen-cmd.sh

Follow the rest of the instructions...
