					<br/><br/>
					<b>Day 2</b>
					<br/><br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="todo">
						Notes in progress. Rearranging some slides - not done!

					</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 3-1 Virtual Machine Images</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">Updated doc.	Kolby says he tested in free acct so that should work.
						Couldn't run in shared acct. Sam is in shared account so if can fix this he can test.
						** Add commands to reeset or re-get password if they missed it the first time as won't appear again.
						(I might have put something in the labs already I don't remember but people that missed getting the password
						couldn't get it again after.)
				</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 3-2 Containers</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">
					Fix the role and missing step. Not sure if I fixed and checked this in already?
					As discused, will add root drive mapping - show how they can see too much, then have them fix. Few add'l steps for lab.
				</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 3-3 S3 + Encryption</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">

				</span>
				<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 3-4 Serverless + API Gateway </b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">
					LDS Director claimed code hardcoded into lambda was not used. Was probably
					just explained wrong in lab. Kolby
					double checking - then Teri + Kolby will talk and verify lab docs match what code is doing.
					Code will do three things - showing secret in code, then not after fix:
					1. creds in code (in python file is fine), 2. Creds in environment var 3. creds passed in via cloudformation shows in params.

				</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Day 4</b>

					<b>Lab 4-2 DevSecOps with Jenkins</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">Add a job - w OWASP dependency checker checking and either reporting on CVEs or blocking
						the deployment if any found - so need some code w/a CVE. The node CLI on my github has a CVE if want to download and include that somehow.
					But there may be something simpler.</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 4-3 Multi-Cloud Deployments</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="code">
					This lab fails in a free trial account for the Azure portion - need to figure out why.
					Multiple people got this error - if they were doing something wrong can update the lab.
					</span>
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Lab 4-4 More Logging and Monitoring</b>
					<br/><br/>
					<span class="ok">
