## What This Script Does

This script creates custom Amazon Q CLI agent with persistent global context. It automates the setup of personalized AI agents that remember your specific rules, preferences, and system information across chat sessions.

## Why Use This Script

- **Persistent Context**: Your agent remembers custom rules and preferences between sessions
- **Personalization**: Create agents tailored to specific workflows or projects
- **Automation**: Eliminates manual agent configuration
- **Consistency**: Ensures your agent always has the same baseline context

### Using Your Custom Agent

Launch a chat session with your agent:

```

### Updating Agent Context
